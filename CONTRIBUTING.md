Hello,

I ran out of time in my 1.5 week project sprint. To give you an example of what I usually write, [here is an example](https://github.com/closeio/ciso8601/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) of a CONTRIBUTING file that I wrote for another project I manage.

A pull request would be welcome for this. See [this issue](https://github.com/movermeyer/ImportFromTodoist/issues/1).
