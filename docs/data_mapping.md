# Introduction

Todoist offers a lot of functionality. `import_from_todoist` tries to maintain as much of that functionality as possible, by defining a mapping between the Todoist Data Model (Tasks, Projects, Due Dates, Labels etc.) and the GitHub Issues data model (Issues, Projects, Milestones, Labels).

This document will describe the mapping that `import_from_todoist` uses when importing data from Todoist into GitHub Issues.

(For a walk-through of how the design decisions of this mapping were made, [see this document](design_decisions.md).)
