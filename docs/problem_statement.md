# Introduction

`import_from_todoist` was originally written as a [take-home coding challenge](https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-expect-from-a-coding-challenge) as part of the interview process for a position at GitHub.

# Problem Description

Below is the original description of the problem as it was emailed to me:

> Many people decide to use GitHub Issues in favor of other task managers or To-Do applications to manage their work and daily tasks. Build a utility in Ruby that connects to another task manager and imports tasks as GitHub Issues using the GitHub API. The importer should include instructions on how to run the utility and any needed prerequisites.
>
>The resulting utility should be capable of importing Issues to any private or public GitHub Repository. It should also import in an appropriate "closed" or "open" state.
>
>We are looking for team members who value collaboration and documentation. We value being able to understand your decision making by reading through your repository. We would love to read in your repository what changes you would make or features you would add if you had more time. Keep these things in mind when working on the challenge.

Then in a separate email:

> No deadline but it shouldn't take more than a couple of weeks.
